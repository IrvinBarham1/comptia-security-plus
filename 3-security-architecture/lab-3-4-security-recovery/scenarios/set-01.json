    "examples": ["Database cluster", "Application cluster"],
    "choices": ["Clustering", "Load balancing", "Virtualization", "Replication"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Clustering groups servers together so if one fails, another continues operation without user interruption."

    "question": "Which recovery site is fully equipped and can take over operations immediately after a failure?",
    "examples": ["Mirrored data center", "Hot standby"],
    "choices": ["Hot site", "Warm site", "Cold site", "Geographic dispersion"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "A hot site contains duplicate systems, data, and connectivity to allow near-instant failover during an outage."

    "examples": ["Basic facility with power and HVAC"],
    "choices": ["Cold site", "Warm site", "Hot site", "Backup office"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "A cold site provides only the physical environment; equipment and data restoration must occur before use."

    "choices": ["Warm site", "Cold site", "Hot site", "Redundant zone"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "A warm site has hardware ready but lacks up-to-date data; it offers faster recovery than a cold site but slower than a hot site."
