# Lab 4.1 ‚Äî Security Operations

## üéØ Objective
**‚ÄúGiven a scenario, apply common security techniques to computing resources.‚Äù**

This lab focuses on implementing and validating **secure configurations**, **hardening procedures**, and **protective controls** across a variety of platforms‚Äîsuch as workstations, mobile devices, servers, and cloud infrastructure.  
It also explores **wireless security**, **mobile deployment models**, and **application-level protection** used to safeguard enterprise systems.

## üìñ Background

Security techniques help ensure that computing environments remain **confidential, available, and trustworthy**.  
They combine configuration standards, system hardening, and monitoring to reduce attack surfaces.

### Key Concepts

| Category | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Secure Baselines** | Establish, deploy, and maintain configuration templates that define approved security settings. |
| **Hardening Targets** | Apply least-privilege and disable unnecessary functions across devices such as servers, switches, routers, IoT, and embedded systems. |
| **Wireless Security** | Strengthen Wi-Fi implementations with WPA3, centralized AAA/RADIUS authentication, and site surveys or heat maps to prevent signal leakage. |
| **Mobile Solutions** | Manage smartphones and tablets through MDM and deployment models such as BYOD, COPE, and CYOD to enforce encryption and remote wipe. |
| **Application Security** | Integrate input validation, secure cookies, static code analysis, and code signing into the development lifecycle. |
| **Sandboxing** | Isolate untrusted code or applications to observe behavior without endangering production systems. |
| **Monitoring** | Continuously collect and analyze logs, alerts, and device telemetry for anomaly detection and policy enforcement. |
