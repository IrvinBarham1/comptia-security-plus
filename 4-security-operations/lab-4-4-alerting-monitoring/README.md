# Lab 4.4 ‚Äî Security Operations

## üéØ Objective
**‚ÄúExplain security alerting and monitoring concepts and tools.‚Äù**

This lab strengthens your ability to **detect, analyze, and respond** to abnormal activity across enterprise environments.  
It emphasizes how continuous monitoring, alert correlation, and automation through tools like **SIEM, SCAP, DLP, and NetFlow** enable early detection and faster response to security threats.

## üìñ Background

Modern organizations rely on **continuous visibility** into their computing resources.  
Security operations teams collect logs, tune alerts, and automate analysis to recognize anomalies before they become incidents.  
A mature alerting and monitoring strategy improves **incident response times**, maintains **regulatory compliance**, and **reduces risk exposure**.

### Core Focus Areas

| Category | Purpose | Example Tools |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Monitoring Computing Resources** | Observe performance and security events across systems, applications, and infrastructure | Cloud telemetry, host metrics, uptime dashboards |
| **Alerting and Validation Activities** | Generate, tune, and verify alerts through scanning, quarantine, and remediation workflows | SIEM correlation, EDR isolation, vulnerability scanning |
| **Security Monitoring Tools** | Automate, detect, and prevent incidents using enterprise security technologies | SCAP, Benchmarks, SNMP traps, DLP, NetFlow, Vulnerability Scanners |
