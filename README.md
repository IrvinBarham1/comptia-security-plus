# CompTIA Security+ Certification Exam Preparation

These are my own coding exercises I developed to help prepare for the **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)** certification exam.  

Each lab is an exercise I built to translate exam objectives into **hands-on, code-driven exercises**. This approach reinforces my exam preparation while also showcasing practical cybersecurity and programming skills.

## ðŸ“Š Exam Domain Alignment

This project is structured around the official Security+ (SY0-701) objectives:

- **General Security Concepts (12%)**  
  Core principles of security, authentication, and encryption fundamentals.

- **Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations (22%)**  
  Attack types, social engineering, malware, and defensive strategies.

- **Security Architecture (18%)**  
  Secure system and network design, segmentation, PKI, and cloud security models.

- **Security Operations (28%)**  
  Monitoring, logging, patching, backup/recovery, and incident response procedures.

- **Security Program Management and Oversight (20%)**  
  Governance, risk, and compliance practices, including risk registers, policy development, vendor management, and program oversight.
