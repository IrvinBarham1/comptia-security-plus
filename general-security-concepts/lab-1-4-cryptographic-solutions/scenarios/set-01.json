    "question": "Which statement best describes Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)?",
    "examples": ["HTTPS", "Email encryption", "VPN authentication"],
    "choices": [
      "A process of encrypting and decrypting data using key pairs",
      "A system of hardware, software, policies, and procedures to manage encryption keys and trust",
      "A symmetric encryption algorithm like AES",
      "A digital certificate used for authentication"

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "PKI is the full system of hardware, software, people, and policies used to manage and distribute keys, not just the cryptographic process."

    "question": "During an HTTPS connection, what role does the server's private key play?",
    "examples": ["TLS handshake", "SSL certificates"],
    "choices": [
      "Encrypting all communication with the client",
      "Decrypting the shared secret key sent by the client",
      "Generating the random symmetric key for the session",
      "Verifying the client's identity"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "In HTTPS, the browser generates a random shared secret key, encrypts it with the server's public key, and the server decrypts it using its private key."

    "choices": [
      "Symmetric encryption is faster and more efficient for bulk data transfer",
      "Asymmetric encryption cannot be used over the internet",
      "Symmetric keys are easier to distribute securely",
      "Asymmetric encryption does not support authentication"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Asymmetric encryption is computationally expensive, so once a symmetric session key is exchanged, it is used for faster data encryption."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The padlock shows that the browser established a secure connection using HTTPS, providing encryption and server authentication."

    "question": "Which of the following best differentiates PKI from public key cryptography?",
    "examples": ["SSL/TLS certificates", "Encryption keys"],
    "choices": [
      "PKI is only used for symmetric encryption, while public key cryptography is for asymmetric",
      "PKI is the broader system managing keys and trust, while public key cryptography refers only to the encryption/decryption process",
      "PKI replaces asymmetric encryption entirely",
      "PKI only applies to web browsers, while public key cryptography applies everywhere"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "PKI is the overall framework for managing key pairs, trust, and policies, while public key cryptography is just the math of using public/private keys."

    "question": "Why might an organization use key escrow as part of its PKI strategy?",
    "examples": ["Legal compliance", "Disaster recovery"],
    "choices": [
      "To prevent attackers from stealing public keys",
      "To ensure encrypted data can be recovered if keys are lost",
      "To eliminate the need for digital certificates",
      "To provide faster key exchange during HTTPS sessions"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Key escrow stores private keys in a secure location so data is not permanently lost if keys are misplaced or inaccessible."

    "examples": ["Escrow vaults", "Third-party storage"],
    "choices": [
      "Escrowed keys can be misused if malicious actors gain access",
      "It prevents organizations from ever retrieving their keys",

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "If escrowed keys are accessed by unauthorized parties, encrypted data can be decrypted, making strong access controls essential."
