# Lab 2.2 ‚Äî Attack Vectors & Delivery Methods

## üéØ Objective
**‚ÄúExplain common threat vectors and attack surfaces.‚Äù**

This section explores how adversaries deliver malicious payloads or gain access to targets using **message-based, network, software, and human vectors.**

---

## üìñ Background

An **attack vector** is the path or method an adversary uses to infiltrate or affect a system.  
Understanding how attacks are delivered helps analysts detect, prevent, and respond to incidents more effectively.

### Categories of Vectors
| Type | Examples |
|:--|:--|
| **Message-based** | Email, SMS (SMiShing), Instant Messaging |
| **Image-based** | Steganography or hidden payloads in media |
| **File-based** | Malicious documents, macros, or scripts |
| **Voice Call** | Vishing / phone-based social engineering |
| **Removable Device** | USB drives, rogue peripherals |
| **Vulnerable Software** | Agent-based vs. agentless flaws |
| **Unsupported Systems** | Legacy apps or OS without patches |
| **Unsecure Networks** | Weak wireless/WEP, exposed wired ports, insecure Bluetooth |
| **Open Service Ports** | Unnecessary or misconfigured services exposed to the internet |
| **Default Credentials & Supply Chain** | Weak vendor defaults, compromised suppliers |
| **Human Vectors / Social Engineering** | Phishing, vishing, smishing, pretexting, impersonation, watering hole, brand impersonation, typosquatting, misinformation/disinformation |
